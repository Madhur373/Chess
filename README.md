# Chess in Python

This is a Python implementation of a **Chess Game** that allows users to play chess against another player. The game features a simple graphical interface using the **Pygame** library and handles the basic rules and logic of chess, including piece movement, turn tracking, and game setup.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface:** The chessboard and pieces are rendered using the Pygame library.
- **Piece Movement:** The game tracks and updates the movement of chess pieces.
- **Turn Management:** Alternates turns between two players (Black and White).
- **Game Reset:** The game board resets for a new match.
- **Piece Setup:** Pieces are placed in their initial positions at the start of the game.
  
## Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   - Download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Install Pygame Library**:
   This project uses Pygame to render the chessboard and pieces. Install Pygame using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-python.git
   ```

4. **Run the Game**:
   Navigate to the project directory and run the game using Python:
   ```bash
   python chess_game.py
   ```

## Usage

- Once the game starts, you will see the chessboard displayed in a Pygame window.
- Players can take turns by clicking on the pieces they want to move.
- The game alternates turns between the black and white sides.
- The board automatically resets when the game ends.

## Game Rules Implemented

- **Piece Movement:** Pieces can be moved according to standard chess rules.
- **Turn-based Play:** Players alternate turns starting with the randomly selected player.
- **Basic Setup:** The game starts with the traditional chess piece setup, with white pieces at the bottom and black pieces at the top.
- **Capture:** Pieces are removed when captured, though special rules for en passant, castling, or pawn promotion may not be implemented.
